# Minecraft Colors

This app helps you build Minecraft palettes and find similar or complementary blocks.

I built it for my own needs, but I hope it can be useful for someone else.
The original dataset and images was taken from [https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-assets](minecraft-assets) (property of Mojang AB). I added color information to the blocks and created a simple search engine with euclidean distance between colors.

I used HSL to easily calculate triadic colors.

(its very WIP)
